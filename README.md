# Muse 2 LSL with Petal Metrics

This repository contains the fundamental code snippet for starting a BCI project using Muse 2 by connecting Muse 2 and Petal Metrics via LSL. I can't test it because I don't have one, but Muse S or any other device from Muse should be compatible. It's consisted of two parts: get_inlet and get_af7_af8. You can modify the code to get specific other channels.
